**PlatformIO** is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who *write applications for embedded products*.
There is a platformIO extension available in <strong>VS code</strong> that makes it easier to use it for embedded systems development professionally as compared to using Arduino IDE which has limited libraries and frameworks to develop embedded systems. 
You can install PLatformIO using the procedure  in [**here**](https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/integration/ide/vscode.html)
